# KoboldCpp Client

!!! abstract "This requires you to have a KoboldCpp instance running"
    If you do not have a KoboldCpp instance running, you can follow their setup instructions 
    in their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp).

!!! info "Support for KoboldCpp's image generation"
    If your KoboldCpp instance loads a stable diffusion model via Automatic1111 the [Visual Agent](/talemate/user-guide/agents/visualizer/) will be automatically configured to use it - unless its already configured to use another backend.

!!! info "Support for KoboldCpp's TTS"
    If your KoboldCpp instance loads a TTS model, the [Voice agent](/talemate/user-guide/agents/voice/) will automatically register it as an OpenAI-compatible backend. See [TTS auto-setup](#tts-auto-setup) below.

If you want to add an KoboldCpp client, change the `Client Type` to `KoboldCpp`.

!!! note "Should work out of the box with a local KoboldCpp instance"
    The default values should work with a local KoboldCpp instance if you have followed their setup instructions and are running the server on the default port.

Click `Save` to add the client.

### Ready to use

Once it is added, the client should appear in the clients list and should display the currently loaded model.

### Settings

##### Client Name

A unique name for the client that makes sense to you.

##### API Url

The URL of your KoboldCpp instance, without any path. For example, `http://localhost:5000`.

!!! info "Use the OpenAI abstraction"
    Talemate supports both their OpenAI api abstraction and their United api. It will default to the United api.
    To use the OpenAI api, append `/v1` to the URL. For example, `http://localhost:5000/v1`.

##### API Key

If the KoboldCpp instance requires an API key, you can set it here.

##### Context Length

The number of tokens to use as context when generating text. Defaults to `8192`.

### Generation Parameters

KoboldCpp supports several advanced generation parameters that you can configure through the [Inference Presets](/talemate/user-guide/clients/presets/) in App Settings.

When using the United API (the default), the following parameters are supported:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Temperature | Controls randomness in generation. Higher values produce more varied output. |
| Top-P | Nucleus sampling - considers tokens comprising the top P probability mass. |
| Top-K | Limits sampling to the K most likely tokens. |
| Min-P | Filters out tokens below a minimum probability threshold relative to the most likely token. |
| Presence Penalty | Penalizes tokens that have already appeared in the text, encouraging the model to discuss new topics. |
| Frequency Penalty | Penalizes tokens based on how frequently they have appeared, reducing repetition of common words. |
| Repetition Penalty | Applies a penalty to repeated tokens within a specified range. |
| XTC | Exclude Top Choices - removes the most likely tokens to encourage more creative outputs. |
| DRY | Don't Repeat Yourself - advanced repetition penalty that targets repeated sequences. |
| Smoothing | Applies quadratic smoothing to the token probability distribution. |
| Adaptive-P | Dynamically adjusts the sampling threshold based on token probabilities. |

!!! note "API Mode Affects Available Parameters"
    The full set of parameters is only available when using the United API (the default). If you append `/v1` to your API URL to use the OpenAI-compatible mode, only a limited subset of parameters (temperature, top_p, presence_penalty, max_tokens) will be sent.

### TTS auto-setup

!!! info "New in 0.37.0"

When a KoboldCpp client has a TTS model loaded, the [Voice agent](/talemate/user-guide/agents/voice/) automatically registers it as an [OpenAI Compatible](/talemate/user-guide/agents/voice/openai-compatible/) backend — no manual configuration needed.

![Auto-registered KoboldCpp backend on the OpenAI Compatible tab](/talemate/img/0.37.0/voice-openai-compatible-management-tab.png)

#### Lifecycle

The Voice agent polls each configured client on its periodic status tick and reacts to whatever the kobold instance currently reports:

| Kobold state | What the Voice agent does |
|---|---|
| Started with a TTS model loaded | Adds a backend named after the client, points it at `<client_url>/v1`, enables it in [Enabled APIs](/talemate/user-guide/agents/voice/settings/#enabled-apis), and refreshes its voice list. |
| Restarted without a TTS model | Disables the backend (drops the slug from Enabled APIs) but **keeps the backend's configuration** so any model overrides, custom voices endpoint, etc. survive. |
| Briefly unreachable | No state change in either direction. Only a definitive answer from KoboldCpp's capabilities endpoint flips the backend on or off. |

When you reload a TTS model on the same kobold instance, the next status tick re-enables the existing backend instead of creating a new one — your previous configuration is reused.

#### Detection

The Voice agent looks at KoboldCpp's `/api/extra/version` capabilities endpoint and reads the `tts` flag. The voice listing is not used for detection because KoboldCpp pre-populates a small set of default voices regardless of whether a TTS model is actually loaded.

Backends are matched by URL. If you manually edit an auto-managed backend's API base URL, the next tick treats it as no longer auto-managed (the URL no longer points at the kobold), and a fresh auto-managed backend is created on the next tick when the kobold still has TTS loaded.

#### Opting out

Auto-setup is governed by the agent-level [Automatic Setup](/talemate/user-guide/agents/voice/settings/#automatic-setup) toggle in the Voice agent's General settings (default on). Turning it off stops the Voice agent from auto-registering or auto-toggling backends from any client, including KoboldCpp. Already-registered backends stay where they are — you can keep them, edit them, or remove them by hand.

### Common issues

#### Generations are weird / bad

Make sure the [correct prompt template is assigned](/talemate/user-guide/clients/prompt-templates/).

#### Could not connect

![Client koboldcpp could not connect](/talemate/img/0.26.0/client-koboldcpp-could-not-connect.png)

This means that either your KoboldCpp instance is not running, the url is incorrect, or the connection is somehow blocked. (For example, by a firewall)
