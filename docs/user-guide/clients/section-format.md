# Section Format

!!! info "New in 0.37.0"
    Per-client setting that controls how prompt sections are delimited. Found on the **Advanced** tab of the [client configuration](client-configuration.md) dialog.

Talemate's prompt templates split their content into named sections (for example *Characters*, *Scene*, *Task*). The **Section Format** setting controls how those section boundaries are rendered in the text that is sent to the model.

## Options

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Talemate decides** (default) | Uses Talemate's built-in default, which is the same output as **Markdown**. Leave this selected unless you have a reason to pick something specific. |
| **Markdown** | Sections open with a Markdown heading, for example `## Characters`. There is no closing marker. |
| **XML** | Sections are wrapped in paired uppercase tags, for example `<CHARACTERS>...</CHARACTERS>`. Spaces in section names become underscores. Empty lines at the start and end of a section are stripped. |

The setting only changes the delimiters Talemate inserts around sections. It does not change what information is sent, the order of sections, or any other part of the prompt.

## Where to set it

![Section Format dropdown on the Advanced tab](/talemate/img/0.37.0/client-config-section-format.png)

1. Click the cogwheels on a client in the sidebar to open its [configuration dialog](client-configuration.md).
2. Open the **Advanced** tab.
3. Pick a value from the **Section Format** dropdown, next to **Structured Data Format**.
4. Click **Save**.

When a non-default value is set, the current choice is shown as a small tag in the client's row in the sidebar so you can see at a glance which clients are using which format.
